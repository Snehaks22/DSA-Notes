# Visualization
Data Visualization is the graphic representation of data. 
It converts a huge dataset into small graphs, thus aiding in data analysis and predictions. 
It is an indispensable element of data science that makes complex data more understandable and accessible. 
Matplotlib and Seaborn act as the backbone of data visualization through Python.
## Matplotlib and Seaborn
Matplotlib is a library in Python that enables users to generate visualizations like histograms, scatter plots, bar charts, pie charts and much more.
It is used for creating statistical inferences and plotting 2D graphs of arrays. \
Seaborn is also a Python library used for plotting graphs with the help of Matplotlib, Pandas, and Numpy. 
It is built on the roof of Matplotlib and is considered as a superset of the Matplotlib library. 
It helps in visualizing univariate and bivariate data. It acts as an important tool in picturing Linear Regression Models.
### Bar Chart
A bar chart depicts numeric values against distinct categories in a two-axis plot.
For each category, one bar is plotted, and its length along the other axis corresponds with the numeric value associated with the category. \
A bar chart is used when you want to show a distribution of data points or perform a comparison of metric values across different subgroups of your data. 


### Pie Chart
A pie chart shows how some total amount is divided among distinct categories as a circle divided into radial slices.
Each category is associated with a single slice whose size corresponds with the categoryâ€™s proportion of the total.
For examples, showing percentages of types of customers, percentage of revenue from different products, and profits from different categories, etc. are easily shown using pie charts.


### Histogram
Unlike bar graphs, which are used for categorical data, histograms are designed for continuous data, grouping it into logical ranges or "bins."


### Scatter plot
A scatter plot is a graphical tool used to display the relationship between two numeric variables.
The relationships observed can either be positive or negative, non-linear or linear, and/or, strong or weak.
The data points or dots, which appear on a scatter plot, represent the individual values of each of those data points and also allow pattern identification when looking at the data holistically.

### Heat Map
Heatmaps are used to show relationships between two variables, one plotted on each axis.
By observing how cell colors change across each axis, you can observe if there are any patterns in value for one or both variables.
The variables plotted on each axis can be of any type, whether they take on categorical labels or numeric values.

### Box Plot
A box plot uses boxes and lines to depict the distributions of one or more groups of numeric data. 
Box limits indicate the range of the central 50% of the data, with a central line marking the median value. 
Box plots are used to show distributions of numeric data values, especially when you want to compare them between multiple groups. 

# Feature Engineering
Feature Engineering is the process of creating new features or transforming existing features to improve the performance of a machine-learning model. 
It involves selecting relevant information from raw data and transforming it into a format that can be easily understood by a model. 
The goal is to improve model accuracy by providing more meaningful and relevant information.
### Feature Orthogonality
### Feature Collinearity
### Feature Slicing
### Indicator Variable
