- SQL keywords are NOT case sensitive
   - select is the same as SELECT
- Semicolon is the standard way to separate each SQL statement in database systems that allow more than one SQL statement to be executed in the same call to the server.
- The PRIMARY KEY constraint uniquely identifies each record in a table.
Primary keys must contain UNIQUE values, and cannot contain NULL values.
A table can have only ONE primary key; and in the table, this primary key can consist of single or multiple columns (fields)
#### SELECT
- The SELECT statement is used to select data from a database.
- SELECT * select all columns from the table
- FROM is a keyword used to specify which table to select or delete data from.
  - eg: SELECT * FROM world; #gives all the columns from the table world
#### LIMIT
