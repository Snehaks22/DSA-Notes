# Statistics
 ## Measures of Central Tendency
 - Mean: It is the average of the given numbers and is calculated by dividing the sum of given numbers by the total number of numbers. Arithmetic mean is affected very much by extreme values.
 - Median: Median of a distribution is the value of the variable which divides it into two equal parts. Median is the only average to be used while dealing with qualitative data. It is not based on all the observations.
 - Mode: It is the value which occurs most frequently in a set of observations. Mode is the average to be used to find the ideal size, eg, in business forcasting, in the manufacture of ready made garments, shoes,etc. 
 - Percentile: It is used to understand the distribution of the data points.
 - Quartiles (Q1,Q2,Q3): These are 3 points which divide the series into four equal parts.
 - Interquartile range: It is calculated by using the formula IQR = Q3-Q1. IQR helps us identify the outliers in the data.
   * Lower bound(LB)= Q1-1.5*IQR
   * Upper bound(UB)= Q3-1.5*IQR
  
   
   Consider any observation that's more than 1.5 IQR below Q1 or more than 1.5 IQR above Q3 as an outlier.
 - Min: Minimum value
 - Max: Maximum value
## Measures of Dispersion
- Range: Range is the differnce between two extreme observations.
Range= Xmax-Xmin
- Quartile Deviation: Semi interquartile range

  Q= (1/2)*(Q3-Q1)

- Variance: Variance is a statistical measurement of the spread between numbers in a data set.

- Standard Deviation: Square root of Variance.
